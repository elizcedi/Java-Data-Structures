Java Data Structures
 
Throughout the videos I learned the data structures needed to work with Java. To work with these one should already be familiar with basic principles of programming. These could be primitive data types and wrapper classes. Practicing with arrays is an advantage when working with data structures.To work with the data structures you use  the IDE, called NetBeans.
	First off I learned that data structures are a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently. efficient data structures are a key to designing efficient algorithms.
	A Stack is an abstract data type or collection where in Push, the addition of data elements to the collection, and Pop, the removal of data elements from the collection, are the major operations performed on the collection. The stack can also be defined as Last in First Out (LIFO).
	A queue is a kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the only operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, called as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, called as dequeue. The queue is called as First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed.
	I also learned a linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node is composed of a data and a link or reference to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.The last node is linked to a terminator used to signify the end of the list.
